    <h4>What is autism?</h4>
    <p>Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), refers to a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication. According to the Centers for Disease Control, autism affects an estimated 1 in 59 children in the United States today.</p>

      <p>We know that there is not one autism but many subtypes, most influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Because autism is a spectrum disorder, each person with autism has a distinct set of strengths and challenges. The ways in which people with autism learn, think and problem-solve can range from highly skilled to severely challenged. Some people with ASD may require significant support in their daily lives, while others may need less support and, in some cases, live entirely independently.</p>

      Several factors may influence the development of autism, and it is often accompanied by sensory sensitivities and medical issues such as gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, seizures or sleep disorders, as well as mental health challenges such as anxiety, depression and attention issues.

      Indicators of autism usually appear by age 2 or 3. Some associated development delays can appear even earlier, and often, it can be diagnosed as early as 18 months. Research shows that early intervention leads to positive outcomes later in life for people with autism.<br><br>

            <a href="#">This is what most people think of when hearing the word "autism."  People with autistic disorder usually have significant language delays, social and communication challenges, and unusual behaviors and interests. Many people with autistic disorder also have intellectual disability.</a>

    <h2><u>TREATMENTS FOR AUTISM</u></h2>
    <p>"What do I do next?" This is a question that has undoubtedly been asked by every parent of a child with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In many cases, it comes after the "What is autism?" and "How did it happen?" Unfortunately, just as with the first two questions, the answer isn't very satisfying. Although many treatments and therapies are proposed to help, few have been studied enough to know whether they really do (or don't) work, and for which children. This reality is frustrating and confusing for families and professionals caring for children with ASD.
    In this section, we explore current autism treatments, the evidence that supports their use, and what we are learning from the experience of individuals and families who have tried them.</p>

            <h3>International Psychology Centre</h3>
            <p>Our preferred method of treatment is Psychotherapy which is a form of counselling. This is a collaborative process where you and your psychologist will work together to change unproductive and negative behavior patterns. It is a supportive, confidential dialogue-based session that provides the opportunity for you to discuss the issue with a professional counselor who is neutral, objective and non judgmental. You would even learn new skills to cope with the stresses you experience regularly.

Psychotherapy alone can be very effective and medication is not always needed alongside treatment unlike what psychiatrists suggest. Through Psychotherapy, we can help individuals of all ages live happier, healthier and more productive lives.
