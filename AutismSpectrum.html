    <h4>What is autism?</h4>
    <p>Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), refers to a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication. According to the Centers for Disease Control, autism affects an estimated 1 in 59 children in the United States today.</p>

      <p>We know that there is not one autism but many subtypes, most influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Because autism is a spectrum disorder, each person with autism has a distinct set of strengths and challenges. The ways in which people with autism learn, think and problem-solve can range from highly skilled to severely challenged. Some people with ASD may require significant support in their daily lives, while others may need less support and, in some cases, live entirely independently.</p>

      Several factors may influence the development of autism, and it is often accompanied by sensory sensitivities and medical issues such as gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, seizures or sleep disorders, as well as mental health challenges such as anxiety, depression and attention issues.

      Indicators of autism usually appear by age 2 or 3. Some associated development delays can appear even earlier, and often, it can be diagnosed as early as 18 months. Research shows that early intervention leads to positive outcomes later in life for people with autism.<br><br>

          <br><h3>What is the type of austism ?</h3>

            <div class="dropdown-content">
            <a href="#">This is what most people think of when hearing the word "autism."  People with autistic disorder usually have significant language delays, social and communication challenges, and unusual behaviors and interests. Many people with autistic disorder also have intellectual disability.</a>

        <div class="container">
<img src="comm.jpg" alt="Communication" style="width:50%;">
<div class="content">
  <h4>Social Communication Challenges</h4>
  <p>Children and adults with autism have difficulty with verbal and non-verbal communication. For example, they may not understand or appropriately use:

    <ul>Spoken language (around a third of people with autism are nonverbal)</ul>
    <ul>Gestures</ul>
    <ul>Eye contact</ul>
    <ul>Facial expressions</ul>
    <ul>Tone of voice</ul>
    <ul>Expressions not meant to be taken literally</ul></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="container">
<img src="restricted.jpg" alt="Restricted" style="width:50%;">
<div class="content">
<h4>Restricted and repetitive behaviors</h4>
<p>Restricted and repetitive behaviors vary greatly across the autism spectrum. They can include:
<ul>Repetitive body movements (e.g. rocking, flapping, spinning, running back and forth)</ul>
<ul>Repetitive motions with objects (e.g. spinning wheels, shaking sticks, flipping levers)</ul>
<ul>Staring at lights or spinning objects</ul>
<ul>Ritualistic behaviors (e.g. lining up objects, repeatedly touching objects in a set order)</ul>
<ul>Narrow or extreme interests in specific topics</ul>
<ul>Need for unvarying routine/resistance to change (e.g. same daily schedule, meal menu, clothes, route to school) </ul></p>
</div>
</div>

<br><h3>Causes of Autism </h3><br><br>
<p>The causes of autism are currently not known, but significant numbers of studies are underway with a view to learning how it develops.
Researchers have identified several genes that appear to have connections to ASD. Sometimes, these genes arise by spontaneously mutate. In other cases, people may inherit them.<br><br>
In studies of twins, autism often has a strong correlation between twins. For example, if one twin has autism, the other is likely to have autism an estimated 36 to 95 percent of the time, according to the NINDS.<br><br>
Those with autism may also undergo changes in key areas of their brains that impact their speech and behavior. Environmental factors might also play a role in the development of ASD, although doctors have not yet confirmed a link.
However, researchers do know that some rumored causes, such as parenting practices, do not cause autism.<br><br>
Although sometimes cited as a cause of autism, there is no evidence that vaccinations cause autism. The exact reason why autism happens isn't clear. Research suggests that it may arise from abnormalities in parts of the brain that interpret sensory input and process language.

<ul>Advanced age of the mother or the father increases the chance of an autistic child.</ul>
<ul>When a pregnant woman is exposed to certain drugs or chemicals, her child is more likely to be autistic. These risk factors include the use of alcohol, maternal metabolic conditions such as diabetes and obesity, and the use of antiseizure drugs during pregnancy. In some cases, autism has been linked to untreated phenylketonuria (called PKU, an inborn metabolic disorder caused by the absence of an enzyme) and rubella (German measles)</ul>

    <h2><u>TREATMENTS FOR AUTISM</u></h2>
    <p>"What do I do next?" This is a question that has undoubtedly been asked by every parent of a child with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In many cases, it comes after the "What is autism?" and "How did it happen?" Unfortunately, just as with the first two questions, the answer isn't very satisfying. Although many treatments and therapies are proposed to help, few have been studied enough to know whether they really do (or don't) work, and for which children. This reality is frustrating and confusing for families and professionals caring for children with ASD.
    In this section, we explore current autism treatments, the evidence that supports their use, and what we are learning from the experience of individuals and families who have tried them.</p>

            <h3>International Psychology Centre</h3>
            <p>Our preferred method of treatment is Psychotherapy which is a form of counselling. This is a collaborative process where you and your psychologist will work together to change unproductive and negative behavior patterns. It is a supportive, confidential dialogue-based session that provides the opportunity for you to discuss the issue with a professional counselor who is neutral, objective and non judgmental. You would even learn new skills to cope with the stresses you experience regularly.

Psychotherapy alone can be very effective and medication is not always needed alongside treatment unlike what psychiatrists suggest. Through Psychotherapy, we can help individuals of all ages live happier, healthier and more productive lives.

                <div class="dropdown-content">
                  <a href="#">Children with ASD have a hard time applying what they’ve learned in one setting (such as the therapist’s office or school) to others, including the home. For example, your child may use sign language at school to communicate, but never think to do so at home. Creating consistency in your child’s environment is the best way to reinforce learning. Find out what your child’s therapists are doing and continue their techniques at home. Explore the possibility of having therapy take place in more than one place in order to encourage your child to transfer what he or she has learned from one environment to another. It’s also important to be consistent in the way you interact with your child and deal with challenging behaviors.</a>

                <div class="dropdown-content">
                  <a href="#">Children with ASD tend to do best when they have a highly-structured schedule or routine. Again, this goes back to the consistency they both need and crave. Set up a schedule for your child, with regular times for meals, therapy, school, and bedtime. Try to keep disruptions to this routine to a minimum. If there is an unavoidable schedule change, prepare your child for it in advance.

                <div class="dropdown-content">
                  <a href="#">Positive reinforcement can go a long way with children with ASD, so make an effort to “catch them doing something good.” Praise them when they act appropriately or learn a new skill, being very specific about what behavior they’re being praised for. Also look for other ways to reward them for good behavior, such as giving them a sticker or letting them play with a favorite toy.

                  <a href="#">Carve out a private space in your home where your child can relax, feel secure, and be safe. This will involve organizing and setting boundaries in ways your child can understand. Visual cues can be helpful (colored tape marking areas that are off limits, labeling items in the house with pictures). You may also need to safety proof the house, particularly if your child is prone to tantrums or other self-injurious behaviors.

                  <a href="#">A child coping with ASD is still a child. For both children with ASD and their parents, there needs to be more to life than therapy. Schedule playtime when your child is most alert and awake. Figure out ways to have fun together by thinking about the things that make your child smile, laugh, and come out of her/his shell. Your child is likely to enjoy these activities most if they don’t seem therapeutic or educational. There are tremendous benefits that result from your enjoyment of your child’s company and from your child’s enjoyment of spending unpressured time with you. Play is an essential part of learning for all children and shouldn’t feel like work.

Figure out what sights, sounds, smells, movements, and tactile sensations trigger your kid’s “bad” or disruptive behaviors and what elicits a positive response. What does your child find stressful? Calming? Uncomfortable? Enjoyable? If you understand what affects your child, you’ll be better at troubleshooting problems, preventing situations that cause difficulties, and creating successful experiences.
