              <h3>International Psychology Centre</h3>
              <p>Our preferred method of treatment is Psychotherapy which is a form of counselling. This is a collaborative process where you and your psychologist will work together to change unproductive and negative behavior patterns. It is a supportive, confidential dialogue-based session that provides the opportunity for you to discuss the issue with a professional counselor who is neutral, objective and non judgmental. You would even learn new skills to cope with the stresses you experience regularly.

  Psychotherapy alone can be very effective and medication is not always needed alongside treatment unlike what psychiatrists suggest. Through Psychotherapy, we can help individuals of all ages live happier, healthier and more productive lives.
